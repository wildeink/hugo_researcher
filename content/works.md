From the paper's abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic illuminated both state failures and state successes with the pandemic itself being a sui generis event. Few countries saw more success than Vietnam, a country considered to have low or limited resources, through much of 2021. This paper addresses this success, one that provides insights into the party-stateâ€™s ability to effectively quell the virus. It also provides insights into notions of authoritarian regime efficacy. The ruling Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) using embedded state capacity, often overlooked in debates regarding pandemic success and political relations in the single party regime-state, to marshaled political mobilisation and successfully contained the virus. This dynamic of state-society relations also marked a retrenchment of previous marketisation of economic life that included healthcare."
