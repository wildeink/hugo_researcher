I recently graduated with Distinction from [SOAS, University of London](https://www.soas.ac.uk/) with a Post-Graduate Master's degree in Area Studies (Southeast Asia). My coursework focused on the politics and political economies of both mainliand and island Southeast Asia. My thesis explored the early success of Vietnam's COVID-19 response in the context of state-society relations. 

I also hold two Bachelor's degrees, both cum laude, from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), one in Information Science and another in Finance.

I spent my early professional life working Pittsburgh, PA, USA in IT for a large chemicals and plastics corporation. I later took several contracts in the US, and Asia that allowed me to work remotely, and from and in various locations including Ha Noi, Vietnam, Bangkok, and Singapore.
