      <description>I recently graduated with Distinction from SOAS, University of London with a Post-Graduate Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Area Studies (Southeast Asia) in an effort to make a career change. My coursework focused on the politics and political economies of both mainliand and island Southeast Asia. My thesis explored the early success of Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s COVID-19 response in the context of state-society relations.
I am currently looking for my first research and analysis position post-graduation.</description>
